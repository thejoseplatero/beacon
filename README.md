# Beacon - Marketing Co-Pilot

A conversational AI co-pilot that shines a light on what matters most by unifying customer signals, campaign performance, delivery effort, and decision history into a single priority narrative.

## Vision & Purpose

Marketing teams are awash in dashboards, feedback tools, and campaign systems. They're under pressure to show ROI, yet spend hours reconciling data and debating priorities.

Beacon is the marketing module of the Neojack OS â€” a conversational co-pilot that delivers clear, explainable answers backed by data and customer voice.

**North Star**: Marketers can ask one question â€” "Where should we focus?" â€” and Beacon delivers a clear, explainable answer backed by data and customer voice.

## Core Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Insights Engine (Chat-First)**
Query analytics + feedback with natural language commands:
- `/insights checkout 30d` â†’ Returns KPIs (conversion, revenue delta) + top customer verbatims
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Voice-of-Customer integration (sentiment, NPS, themes)

### ðŸ“Š **Prioritization Engine**
Common scoring model: `(Impact Ã— Confidence) Ã· (Effort Ã— Risk)`
- Inputs: analytics (impact), feedback (confidence), work items (effort & risk)
- Output: ranked "opportunity stack" with evidence
- Command: `/prioritize [criteria]`

### ðŸ“‹ **Decision Desk Export**
Turn any insight/opportunity into a decision card:
- Problem statement
- Options with tradeoffs (impact, effort, risk)
- Recommended next step
- Command: `/decision [opportunity-id]`
